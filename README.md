Pear is a framework project focused on e-commerce. 
Developed to reduce time and costs in the production of basic web sites.

The project is in pre-Alpha phase, so it is not recommended to use the templates that will be uploaded, as they are not stable and are subject to correction.

The use of the new classes and tools for development will be explained in the documentation.

Pear is a framework designed to be used completely, but if you want to use only one function of it you must copy its respective parts from the HTML and CSS files.

For a better experience it's recommended to use the Normalize.css library

Following you will see the ways to customize this framework in each of its parts using the pear.css file.

The buttons are the only tag that has options to change aspects, which are the following:

Buttons of type <a> have two class="a or b" .
These two options will change the color of the button from the generic color of the project Pear (Green) to a more professional gray color for commercial use.
